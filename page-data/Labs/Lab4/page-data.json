Robot Shop is a sample microservice application that you can use as a sandbox to test and learn containerized application orchestration and monitoring techniques. We will be utilizing the Stan’s Robot Shop for all the labs following this. Note that Robot Shop has been pre-installed by your training team. Through this lab, you’ll run Robot Shop locally and use Instana to view key metrics about the application.\n\n## Step 1:\n\nSSH into thehost that was provided by your instructor, and browse to the installation directory for Robot Shop \n\n```\ncd /home/ubuntu/robot-shop\n\n```\n\n## Step 2:\n\nIn your terminal window type \n\n```\ndocker-compose up -d\n```\n\nNote: -d runs it in the background\n\n## Step 3:\n\nValidate that Stan’s Robot Shop is up by going to:\n\nhttp://(publicip):8080\n\nIf successful, you will see the following page:\n\n![Lab 4](images/4.1.png)\n\nFeel free to navigate around and buy some robots!\n\n## Step 4:\n\nFind your host in the Instana UI on the Infrastructure screen.\n\nHover your mouse over the host and notice all the entities being shown.\n\n![Lab 4](images/4.2.png)\n\nOpen the host dashboard and see all of the components of Robot Shop visible.\n\nClick on a few of them to open their respective dashboards and find the metrics streaming in automatically.\n\n![Lab 4](images/4.3.png)\n\n![Lab 4](images/4.4.png)\n\n## Step 5:\n\nNow we will generate the Robot Shop Load.\n\nBrowse to a directory within the robot-shop directory called “load-gen”\n\n```\ncd /home/ubuntu/robot-shop/load-gen\n```\n\nIn your terminal window type: \n\n```\nsudo ./load-gen.sh -d\n```\n\nExecute the following command to confirm that the loadgen container is running:\n\n```\ndocker ps | grep loadgen\n```\n\n![Lab 4](images/4.5.png)\n\nWe will move on for now, but we will find the robot shop data in the Instana UI a little later in the training.","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"820274575f1234a6e2796955396774b4","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":200},"frontmatter":{"title":"Lab4"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Lab4\n---\nexport const Title = () => (\n  <span>\n    Lab 4 - Robot Shop <br />\n  </span>\n);\n;\n\n## Lab Overview\n\nIn this lab you will be introduced to Robot Shop.
