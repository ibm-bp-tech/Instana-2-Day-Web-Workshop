You will learn to access your log files, change your log level to view more troubleshooting detail, and stop and start your agent service for the purpose of troubleshooting your agent. \n\n## Step 1:\n\nWe will SSH into the machine that was provided to us. Agent logs are located at:\n\n```\ncd /opt/instana/agent/data/log\n```\n\nIn the event that there is an issue, this would be where we would pull our logfiles. \n\nThis is an important area to have knowledge of, as support will ask for these logs during troubleshooting sessions. \n\nIt is also possible to download the logs in the UI if you have access to the UI.\n\n## Step 2: \n\nTo start agent debug logging, you will need to stop the agent.\n\nEnter the following in your terminal window:\n\n```\nsudo service instana-agent stop\n```\n\nWe can then validate that the service has stopped by entering:\n\n```\nsudo service instana-agent status\n```\n\nHint: type “:q” to exit status command.\n\n![Lab 2](images/2.3.png)\n\n\n## Step 3:\n\nDelete all of the files in /opt/instana/agent/data/log\n\n```\nsudo rm /opt/instana/agent/data/log/*\n```\n\nCheck to make sure files are deleted.\n\n## Step 4:\n\nTo set the log level to debug, first browse to \n\n```\ncd /opt/instana/agent/etc\n```\n\nWe will be editing org.ops4j.pax.logging.cfg using the vi editor.\n\nNote that a list of common vi commands are provided towards the end of this lab material in the Reference - vi Editor section. \n\nAn alternative to the vi editor is nano. I may be easier for those that are not familiar with the vi editor.\n\n```\nsudo vi org.ops4j.pax.logging.cfg\n```\n\n![Lab 2](images/lab2.2.png)\n\nNow, change from INFO to DEBUG on the line seen below.\nCheck out vi commands if you are experiencing an issue.\n\n![Lab 2](images/lab2.3.png)\n\nOnce you have modified with the proper value, save your work.\n\n## Step 5:\n\nStart the agent by entering the following line into the terminal window:\n\n```\nsudo service instana-agent start\n```\n\nValidate that the service has started by entering:\n\n```\nsudo service instana-agent status\n```\n\n## Step 6:\n\nVerify logging is now at Debug by viewing the agent.log file after navigating to\n\n```\ncd /opt/instana/agent/data/log\n```\n\nFeel free to revert the log level to INFO if you'd like.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"229d9191d987eaff02c77fd3a17451f2","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":198},"frontmatter":{"title":"Lab2"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Lab2\n---\nexport const Title = () => (\n  <span>\n    Lab 2 - Agent Troubleshooting <br />\n  </span>\n);\n;\n\n## Lab Overview\n\nIn this lab you will be focusing on Linux deployments of the Instana agent.
