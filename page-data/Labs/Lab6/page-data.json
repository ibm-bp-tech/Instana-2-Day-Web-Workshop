The Application Perspective (AP) auto-generates a feature rich monitoring dashboard where users can stay focused on the services they are interested in and not be distracted. AP’s can be customizable by technology, zone/cluster, version/release, and more. Alerts, errors, and logs are scoped to an AP to focus the troubleshooting.\n\n## Step 1:\n\nClick on the STAN icon\n\n![Lab 6](images/6.1.png)\n\nFor the purposes of this lab, we will be utilizing the tags that we created in the previous labs.
